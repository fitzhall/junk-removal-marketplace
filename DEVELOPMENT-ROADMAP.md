## 🔴 **CRITICAL GAPS** (Must Fix)

### **Priority 1: Booking Flow** 🚨
**Status:** BROKEN - Quote ID not returned from API

**Issues:**
- ❌ Quote API doesn't return `id` in response
- ❌ BookingScheduler receives undefined `quoteId`
- ❌ Booking creation fails silently

**Impact:** Customers cannot complete bookings

**Fix Required:**
1. Update `/api/quotes/create` to return quote ID
2. Ensure quote is saved to database before returning
3. Test end-to-end flow from photo → booking

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

### **Priority 2: Provider Bidding System** 🎯
**Status:** MISSING - Core marketplace functionality

**What's Needed:**
- ❌ Provider bid submission interface
- ❌ Bid viewing for providers
- ❌ Customer bid review UI
- ❌ Bid acceptance/rejection flow
- ❌ Price negotiation capability

**User Stories:**
1. Provider sees new lead → submits bid with price
2. Customer sees multiple bids → compares providers
3. Customer accepts bid → job confirmed
4. System notifies both parties

**API Endpoints Needed:**
- `POST /api/bids/create` - Provider submits bid
- `GET /api/bids/[quoteId]` - Get bids for quote
- `POST /api/bids/[id]/accept` - Customer accepts bid
- `POST /api/bids/[id]/reject` - Customer rejects bid

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

6. **Job completion** (request review)

**Service Recommendation:** Resend.com (simple, modern)

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL DEBT**

### **Code Quality Issues**
1. `google-vision-broken.ts` - Delete unused file
2. Type safety - Some `any` types need proper interfaces
3. Error handling - Inconsistent patterns
4. API response formats - Need standardization
5. Environment variables - Need validation
6. Testing - No automated tests yet

### **Performance Optimizations**
1. Image compression - Could be more aggressive
2. API caching - No Redis/caching layer
3. Database indexes - Need query optimization
4. Bundle size - Could be reduced
5. Lazy loading - More components could be lazy

## 📝 **NOTES**

### **Design Decisions**
- Using Prisma for type-safe database access
- Supabase PostgreSQL for scalability
- Google Vision API for image analysis
- Cloudinary for image storage
- Next.js 14 App Router
- Tailwind + Framer Motion for UI

### **Cost Considerations**
- Google Vision: ~$1.50 per 1000 images
- Cloudinary: Free tier (25 credits/month)
- Supabase: Free tier sufficient for MVP
- Vercel: Free tier for hosting
- Email: Resend free tier (100 emails/day)

### **Scaling Considerations**
- Vision API has rate limits
- Database connection pooling needed at scale
- Image storage will need CDN
- Email service will need upgrade
- Consider queue system for heavy processing
